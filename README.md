## Message to the project reviewer

Dear Project Evaluator,
I am very sorry to notify you that I have not been able to complete this project within the timeframe set by Code Institute.
Because of my personal situation and my inability to convince Student Support to delay the submission of the third and fourth projects, I have no choice but to comply with the requirements imposed by Code Institute and submit this message in place of the required project.
In the spirit of avoiding the futile effort required to evaluate such an incomplete project, I have decided to submit it completely empty, in the hope that I can exceed the expectations of this course by resubmitting a project worthy of evaluation at a future date.

I am very sorry to have arrived at this situation and I appeal to your good judgement and understanding.

Kind regards
Juan Manuel de las Heras Arroyo.
